        <p>
        I focus on writing clean, elegant and efficient code<br/>
        When I'm not coding you'll find me dancing, gardening or working out in the park<br/>
        For a year I have been working on projects as a freelance, answering startup inquiries and collaborating with people to create digital products with solutions<br/>
        I want to keep learning, finding challenges and doing interesting things that matter<br/>
        I look for opportunities with companies, agencies, individuals to solve real business problems<br/>
